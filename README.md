# datastructures

I am reading Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by Robert Lafore

- My programs are version controlled in this repo
- Although I try to write the programs myself, I later compare it with the code provided by author and align it to his recommendations
- I hope this GitHub repo helps me continue my efforts seamlessly from both home and office

Wish me Good Luck !!!
